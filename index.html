                    Video game addiction is not the same as casual gaming. Casual gaming refers to playing video games in moderation, without negative consequences for oneâ€™s life. Video game addiction, on the other hand, involves excessive and persistent gaming that interferes with daily life activities, relationships, and personal well-being. The critical difference between the two is the individualâ€™s level of control over their gaming habits. Casual gaming allows individuals to engage in gaming without it taking over their lives, while video game addiction can lead to a loss of control and negative consequences.
