                    Video game addiction is not the same as casual gaming. Casual gaming refers to playing video games in moderation, without negative consequences for one’s life. Video game addiction, on the other hand, involves excessive and persistent gaming that interferes with daily life activities, relationships, and personal well-being. The critical difference between the two is the individual’s level of control over their gaming habits. Casual gaming allows individuals to engage in gaming without it taking over their lives, while video game addiction can lead to a loss of control and negative consequences.
